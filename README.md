The purpose of this ML Web App is to make a dynamic prediction of the type of a flower based on its characteristics:

* Sepal length
* Sepal width
* Petal length
* Petal width

This project requires to have `sklearn` and `pandas` installed with Python, in order to import the dataset that contains the information of the flowers and to execute a random forest classification to predict the variety of the flower.

Procedure:
1. Write the code in Atom and save it as a .py file

2. Launch Anaconda prompt to have Streamlit execute the .py file in a virtual server

3. Change the values of the flowerâ€™s characteristics in the left panel to predict in real time the variety of the flower
